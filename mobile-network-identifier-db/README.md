# Mobile Network Identifier with Database



This application allows a user to determine a mobile number's network/carrier given a prefix. The user will first see an app without data in it and after updating the database either by adding the default prefixes or manually adding them, the user can get its equivalent network.

The user has also the option to purge the default prefixes and add them back in one button click.
